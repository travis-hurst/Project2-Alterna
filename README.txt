This project is a web application using JS, node.js, and ReactJS with multiple different views.
App was created using React Create and npm create vite@4.1.0.  
Unzip the main file folder, open folder in VS Code, and be sure to install the correct 
dependencies. (listed below under the dependencies tab.)

See configuration tab below to set up and run the application.

With the application running, you should see the homescreen as a room. There are four furniture pieces
to select that have different features. The Announcement table, Bounty board, Navigation table, and Achievement
 shelf. These different dialogs allow you to see information on each of the three classes, they currently do
 not navigate to Canvas. This is sufficient to show the functionality of these view.
