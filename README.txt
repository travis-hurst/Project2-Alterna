## Project Functionality

This project is a web application using JS, node.js, and ReactJS with multiple different views.
App was created using React Create and npm create vite@4.1.0.  
Unzip the main file folder, open folder in VS Code, and be sure to install the correct 
dependencies. (listed below under the dependencies tab.)

See configuration tab below to set up and run the application.

// TODO: Change this to the Alterna-Canvas Instructions //
With the application running, you should be able to navigate through three main views. 
The home screen, recipe search, and recipe guide. The recipe guide can only be accessed 
from Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner recipe selections from the recipe search screen. 
Currently there is only one recipe used on the recipe guide screen, regardless of which recipe 
is selected. This is sufficient to show the functionality of this view.
